QRCode
======

I created this in my first year of university. It's a project that has been done many times but I wanted a deeper understanding
of QR Codes and how exactly to produce them to store the information that you want them to store.

This is just one file that has one class with many methods in it. It is simply a QRCode Reader application in Python.
